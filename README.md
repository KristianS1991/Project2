# SEI Project Two, Hackathon - Front-End React Application

## Timeframe
2 days

## Technologies Used
* React
* Webpack
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS
* GitHub

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run `npm run serve` within the repository folder in the terminal.

## Project Scope
For our second project, we were put into groups of two and given a timeframe of two days to complete a front-end application using React. We were to pick a theme, and implement a relevant API to populate our application with data. We were also required to use Webpack, as our module builder, for bundling and deployment purposes.

## Project Overview


## Process Breakdown
The process of creating this application can be broken down into a series of stages as follows:
#### Research Stage:
1. Brainstorming ideas for the application.
2. Researching open-source APIs relevant to our idea.
3. Requesting an access token for these APIs.
4. Testing AJAX requests to the APIs with Insomnia, to ensure sufficient data in the response.

#### Preliminary Design/Configuration Stages:
1. Drawing wireframes for each of the webpages.
2. Drawing a flowchart for the user experience.
3. Pseudocoding the functionality for each of the components.
3. Configure the module builder, Webpack, ie. installing dependencies, adding `app.js` and `index.html` etc.

#### Development & Testing Stages:
1. Setup a backbone `index.html` template, in which to render the JavaScript.
2. Build a router in the `app.js` file, containing the paths to each React component.
3. Develop and Test each component.
4. Style the application.

#### Deployment & Presentation Stages:
1. Deploy the application to GitHub Pages.
2. Present our application to the class.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge of this project that we faced was related to time management. Given only two days to create our first React application, it was difficult to plan exactly how much content and functionality we had time to achieve. We decided rather than working separately and then merging our work into one app, we would pair code through the whole project. This way, we could ensure we agreed before adding new features and we could brainstorm about different approaches to solving the same problem.

## Future Add-ons
There were two main extra features I would have liked to add to this project. Due to timing constraints, I did not get the opportunity to add these features.
